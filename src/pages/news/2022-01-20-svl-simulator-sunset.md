LG has made the difficult decision to suspend active development of SVL Simulator, as of January 1, 2022.

There are no plans for any new or bugfix releases of SVL Simulator in 2022. There will be no new source code changes pushed to GitHub, and there will be no reviews or merging of Pull Requests submitted on GitHub for SVL Simulator or any of its related plug-ins. There will be no new simulator assets built and shared nor updates made to existing assets by the SVL Simulator team.

We will make a reasonable effort to keep the [wise.svlsimulator.com](https://wise.svlsimulator.com) website up and running through at least Thursday, June 30, 2022, and will also maintain the [SVLSimulator.com](https://SVLSimulator.com) web site including the [simulator documentation](https://www.svlsimulator.com/docs/) pages through at least Thursday, June 30, 2022.

At this time we do not plan to remove the [SVL Simulator source code](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator) (and related plug-in) projects from GitHub. The open source project and source code will remain available for anyone who wants to build (or modify) SVL Simulator.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.

Sincerely,

The SVL Simulator team

#### Questions

##### **Q: Will SVL Simulator run locally without the [wise.svlsimulator.com](https://wise.svlsimulator.com) web site?**

A: The latest released version of SVL (2021.3) requires the use of the WISE (web user interface) cloud service to download assets, configure simulation clusters, and create and launch simulations. It may be possible to remove this dependency (e.g. in a fork; see below) and then build and launch a local simulator instance.

##### **Q: Will LG release the source code for the WISE (web user interface) cloud service?**

A: There are no plans at this time to release the source code for WISE.

##### **Q: Would LG be interested in transferring the SVL Simulator project to someone interested in taking over the project?**

A: There are no plans at this time to transfer the SVL Simulator project (or the WISE cloud service).

##### **Q: Will the Simulator Software License Agreement be changed?**

A: There are no plans at this time to change the [Simulator Software License Agreement](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/blob/master/LICENSE).

##### **Q: Can users share source code changes and forks of SVL Simulator?**

A: As a GitHub project, anyone is able to create their own fork; in fact, there are already over 500 such forks of the [SVL Simulator project](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator). Users can then make changes and even submit pull requests back to the original (parent) project. While we have no plans to review or merge such changes into the main project, users are free to review open PRs and create their own local build from their own or any other public fork.

##### **Q: Can users share new builds of SVL Simulator?**

A: The [Simulator Software License Agreement](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/blob/master/LICENSE) allows you to “modify or create derivative works of the Licensed Materials” and only restricts their commercial use. Therefore, it is ok for users to share new builds of SVL Simulator as long as such builds are not sold or otherwise used for commercial purposes.

##### **Q: What about the SVL Simulator Premium product and/or cloud simulation service?**

A: There are no plans at this time to offer a SVL Simulator Premium product or cloud service.

##### **Q: Can users still post technical questions on GitHub?**

A: Technical questions may be posted to the [SVL Simulator Issues](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/issues) page on GitHub but may not be answered by the SVL Simulator team. We encourage users to help each other with questions or issues that are posted.

##### **Q: What if there are other questions not addressed in this document?**

A: Other questions may be posted to the [SVL Simulator Issues](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/issues) page on GitHub.
