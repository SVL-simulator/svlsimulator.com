### Creating a new account for the 2021.1 release

With the new 2021.1 SVL Simulator release, you will need to sign up for a new account, even if you already have an account with the previous LGSVL Simulator web user interface.

SVL Simulator web interface: [https://wise.svlsimulator.com](https://wise.svlsimulator.com)

Once you sign up, you will need to confirm your email address to begin running simulations.

See our [docs](https://www.svlsimulator.com/docs) for guides on getting started.

### Support for 2020.06 release and older

If you are using the [2020.06](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/releases/tag/2020.06) release or older, you can still use the previous account system to login and use the simulator. This account **will not** work with the new SVL Simulator web interface above.

You can still login and access content for old version of simulator at: 

* Login: [https://account.lgsvlsimulator.com/](https://account.lgsvlsimulator.com/])

* Asset content: [https://content.lgsvlsimulator.com/](https://content.lgsvlsimulator.com/)

* Docs for 2020.06 and older: [Documentation Archive](https://www.svlsimulator.com/docs/archive/)

The content is also linked in the footer of our [new website](https://www.svlsimulator.com/) for easy access.

**NOTE**: With the new [2021.1](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/releases/tag/2021.1) release, we will be deprecating new account creation on older releases within the coming months. Please look out for details and sign up for our [newsletter](http://eepurl.com/htlRjH) to stay up to date on our announcements.
