We are happy to announce that we are changing our name and branding from LGSVL Simulator to SVL Simulator. Coinciding with our latest [2021.1](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/releases/tag/2021.1) release, we have refreshed the product name to be more responsive and simple in order to communicate with our users around the world. SVL Simulator is developed by LG Electronics at the America R&D Lab in Santa Clara, California.

If someone is asking what simulation tool you are using, let them know it is now SVL Simulator. We believe the new branding will be more intuitive and to the point. We will continue to innovate, support our open source community, and iterate based on feedback from our users.
