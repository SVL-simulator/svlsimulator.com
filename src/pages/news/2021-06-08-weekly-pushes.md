We have excellent news for our subscribers.

### Up-to-date code on GitHub master
We are aiming to do more frequent pushes to the Simulator github [master](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/tree/master) branch. Expect the [master](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/tree/master) branch to be unstable, but have our latest features and fixes. Some of the features that land on the [master](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/tree/master) branch may still be **work-in-progress**. If you need a stable build, please use our [release](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/tree/release-2021.1) branches and [binary](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/releases) releases.

**IMPORTANT**: The [master](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/tree/master) branch of Simulator is compatible with the master branch of other related components, and release tags are compatible with the release tags in other repositories.

### Master vs. Release: Cloud Web User Interface
We are rolling out a new [preview](https://wise.preview.svlsimulator.com) web user interface to maintain compatibility between the web interface and the [upstream](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/tree/master) Simulator. This deployment has our latest UI and features, enabled to work with the [master](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/tree/master) branch of Simulator. Our [production](https://wise.svlsimulator.com) web user interface will **ONLY** support [released](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/releases) versions of Simulator.

**IMPORTANT**:
1.	[Preview](https://wise.preview.svlsimulator.com) deployment can only be used with the [master](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/tree/master) branch, and **YOUR DATA WILL BE ERASED** regularly. So, please use it for development or experiments only. You will need to re-register your account on [preview](https://wise.preview.svlsimulator.com) every time data is wiped.

1.	Please avoid uploading assets built using the Simulator [master](https://wise.preview.svlsimulator.com) branch to the [production](https://wise.svlsimulator.com) interface. New content may not be compatible with the [release](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/releases) version of Simulator. We will remove content incompatible with the Simulator [release](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/releases) from the [production](https://wise.svlsimulator.com) website without warning.
