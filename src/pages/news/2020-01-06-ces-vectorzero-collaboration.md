We are happy to announce cooperation between SVL Simulator and [VectorZero](https://vectorzero.io) to bring maps and environments produced by the VectorZero RoadRunner tool into SVL Simulator for our users.

We believe enabling users to quickly create and generate their own 3D environments and HD maps is a critical aspect of autonomous vehicle simulation, allowing comprehensive test coverage for planning, routing, and end-to-end integration testing through scenarios built in customized and realistic maps. Interoperating with RoadRunner, the SVL Simulator platform enhances the set of tools available to developers to easily create their own 3D environments to test their specific use cases during autonomous vehicle development.

At CES 2020, LG Electronics will be demonstrating a 3D environment created using the RoadRunner tool and imported into SVL Simulator. With LG and VectorZero, users will be able to create a 3D road network using the RoadRunner tool, export the 3D environment and the corresponding HD map for use with SVL Simulator, and run simulations within the fully-supported environment, including testing with an AD stack on one or more ego vehicles, simulating traffic scenarios with non-ego vehicles and pedestrians, and varying environmental conditions for perception testing.

A video showing a 3D environment in SVL Simulator, created using RoadRunner. It can be connected with any AD stack, and enables developers to create and run custom scenarios using our Python API.

As the official simulation platform supporting the Autoware Foundation, and the simulator of choice for many Apollo developers, SVL Simulator is a powerful and growing platform for development and testing of autonomous vehicle systems. The collaboration with VectorZero will offer our community of users not just a larger library of maps for testing, but additional flexibility in creating the exact test scenarios they want to test.
