The upcoming April 2019 release of SVL Simulator will include support for Baidu's Apollo 3.5. Our new CyberRT bridge will enable data transfer between sensors in the simulator and Apollo 3.5. Additionally, we show a preview of the Python API interface for the simulator, which includes starting/stopping, adding ego/non-ego vehicles, and controlling the environment.

Finally, we show the warehouse robot model we added for one of our partners, [MOV.AI](http://mov.ai), which is integrated with ROS. The source for this particular model is available in our repository.
