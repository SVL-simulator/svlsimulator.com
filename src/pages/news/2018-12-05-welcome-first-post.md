## Welcome to the new SVL Simulator website!

This website contains information about LG Silicon Valley Lab's autonomous vehicle simulator.
It will act as a central place to direct developers and interested users of our simulator to our GitHub page, documentation, and information about our latest developments.
On this blog, we will post news about our team's progress, post new videos showing new features that solve users' pain points, and announce our releases and roadmap. Please stay tuned, and always feel free to contact us with questions or for more information.
