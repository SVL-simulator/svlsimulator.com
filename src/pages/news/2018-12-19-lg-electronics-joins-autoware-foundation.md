> We are excited to join the Autoware Foundation and to offer LG's autonomous driving simulator with built-in support for Autoware to facilitate research, development, and testing of autonomous software. We look forward to collaborating with foundation members and the community at large as we drive towards an autonomous future together.

As we continue in our collaboration with the Autoware stakeholders and users, we hope that the SVL Simulator will be able to help accelerate autonomous driving development with Autoware and build an open and collaborative community around one of the most important aspects of autonomous driving development that is simulation.
