author: Brian Shin
preview: This video highlights some of our added functionality to the simulator. You can now use Apollo's Navigation Mode, which uses only low-cost sensors like radar and camera. In navigation mode, the vehicle can follow a navigation as well as detect obstacles and lane lines.

This video highlights our additional features that were added to the simulator. We are now including our HD/Vector map annotation tool within the simulator. You can use this tool to create HD maps within the 3D environment in the simulator, annotating lanes with waypoints, lane merge points, stop lines, traffic lights, and intersections. Furthermore, you can export this HD map from the simulator to the Apollo or Autoware map formats. Test your path planning/routing/control modules with our simulator!

Additionally, we have added a detailed school bus non-player-character (NPC) model as part of traffic. You can now test various situations in traffic with various types of vehicles, including this school bus, SUVs, sedans, and trucks.
