By providing\n          all necessary inputs needed from a virtual environment, reacting to controls, and simulating the situations a\n          vehicle may encounter, developers can perform integration testing of their system from the very beginning of\n          the development cycle. In addition to performing modular component-wise testing, developers can perform\n          end-to-end testing to shorten the iteration cycle for finding and testing integration considerations of their\n          autonomous system.\n        </Typography>\n      </Section>\n\n      <Section title='Data and content'>\n        <Typography>\n          LG supports a wide array of sensors such as camera, LiDAR, RADAR, CGP, and IMU hardware sensors for simulation\n          as well as virtual ground truth sensors.

Perception module development requires a vast amount of labeled data specific to\n          vehicle sensor configuration, however data labeling is mostly manual process and time consuming.
