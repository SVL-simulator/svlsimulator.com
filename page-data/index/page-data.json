LG helps the world’s leading OEMs and suppliers harness the power of autonomous driving technologies and solutions to simulate and accelerate the service innovation, optimize vehicle performance, gain insight from data and take advantage of the cloud platform to scale the mobility operations.","section1":{"title":"Simulation for end-to-end development cycle","body":"LGSVL Simulator supports end-to-end simulation of the entire autonomous driving software stack. By providing all necessary inputs needed from a virtual environment, reacting to controls, and simulating the situations a vehicle may encounter, developers can perform integration testing of their system from the very beginning of the development cycle. In addition to performing modular component-wise testing, developers can perform end-to-end testing to shorten the iteration cycle for finding and testing integration considerations of their autonomous system."},"section2":{"title":"Data and content","body":["LG supports a wide array of sensors such as camera, LiDAR, RADAR, CGP, and IMU hardware sensors for simulation as well as virtual ground truth sensors. Real world sensor models used in the autonomous vehicle systems and other sensors through plugins are also supported in LGSVL Simulator.","The 3D environment is the basis for environmental simulation and impacts all sensor data, affects an AD system’s perception, prediction, tracking and control modules. LGSVL Simulator Premium Platform’s Digital Twin enables the creation of synthetic 3D environments, for replication and simulation of logged real-world scenarios. Through Digital Twin environments, test drives recorded and logged in the real world can be imported into simulation to re-simulate particularly targeted edge case scenarios."]},"section3":{"title":"Cloud simulation as a service","body":["Simulation in the cloud at scale is one of the important features requested by developers working on autonomous vehicle software. Perception module development requires a vast amount of labeled data specific to vehicle sensor configuration, however data labeling is mostly manual process and time consuming. Simulators could be used to produce synthetic labeled data at large scale in the cloud.","LGSVL Simulator also accelerates and facilitates reinforcement learning for Planning module development which requires millions of runs in order to find optimal behavior. LGSVL Simulator features out of box integration with OpenAI Gym environment that allows for running faster than real time locally and in the cloud either as an on-premise or private cloud configuration."]}},"cloud":{"title":"Cloud Simulation-as-a-Service","body":["Ability to resimulate with local simulation - not just on remote servers","Sensor data visualization","Test case analysis reports and event detection","Content ecosystem - maps, vehicles, sensors, plugins from partners and community"]},"digitaltwin":{"title":"Digital Twin creation service","body":"We offer environment creation services for different levels of environment fidelity based on your needs.
