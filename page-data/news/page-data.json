We have since built LGSVL Simulator into a commercial product helping automotive OEMs, robotics companies, and universities around the world.","Our team consists of highly-qualified engineers and specialists, with years of experience from industries including automotive, robotics, software, consumer electronics, and mobile technology.","We believe in simulation as the key to accelerating autonomous machine development. Our vision is to bring about a standardized simulation platform used in autonomous vehicle and robotics development, and believe open source is key to making this happen."],"mission":{"title":"Our mission","body":"To enable future mobility powered by autonomy"},"vision":{"title":"Our Vision","body":"Simulation is the key accelerator for Future mobility driven by autonomy We will become the de-facto simulation platform for future mobility."}},"usecases":{"navTitle":"Use cases","title":"A simulation platform for your application","body":"Build safer self-driving cars, autonomous machines, or robots for your industry with testing in virtual environments.","section1":{"title":"Automotive","body":"In addition to autonomous vehicles, use LGSVL Simulator to simulate and test future mobility services that interact with our world in new ways: delivery robots, robotaxis, ridesharing and personal mobility services. Simulate and test not just for software and system development but for fleet management, mobility service operations, and infrastructure planning."},"section2":{"title":"Robotics","body":"Develop and test your indoor, outdoor, or multi-modal robots. Simulate an on-site deployment and how multi-robot interactions and environments will work. Iterate on your development in a safe manner before costly pilot deployments. Show your customers exactly how a deployment will work in their warehouse or factory before shipping any hardware."},"section3":{"title":"Academia","body":"Generate synthetic data for machine learning training and research. Conduct research for every module of an autonomous vehicle, or for their integration and larger impacts. Security, safety, multi-robot interactions, and vehicle to infrastructure are just some of the research applications we see from our community."},"section1_old":{"title":"Simulation for end-to-end development cycle","body":"LGSVL Simulator supports end-to-end simulation of the entire autonomous driving software stack. By providing all necessary inputs needed from a virtual environment, reacting to controls, and simulating the situations a vehicle may encounter, developers can perform integration testing of their system from the very beginning of the development cycle. In addition to performing modular component-wise testing, developers can perform end-to-end testing to shorten the iteration cycle for finding and testing integration considerations of their autonomous system."},"section2_old":{"title":"Data and content","body":["LG supports a wide array of sensors such as camera, LiDAR, RADAR, CGP, and IMU hardware sensors for simulation as well as virtual ground truth sensors. Real world sensor models used in the autonomous vehicle systems and other sensors through plugins are also supported in LGSVL Simulator.","The 3D environment is the basis for environmental simulation and impacts all sensor data, affects an AD system’s perception, prediction, tracking and control modules. LGSVL Simulator Premium Platform’s Digital Twin enables the creation of synthetic 3D environments, for replication and simulation of logged real-world scenarios. Through Digital Twin environments, test drives recorded and logged in the real world can be imported into simulation to re-simulate particularly targeted edge case scenarios."]},"section3_old":{"title":"Cloud simulation as a service","body":["Simulation in the cloud at scale is one of the important features requested by developers working on autonomous vehicle software. Perception module development requires a vast amount of labeled data specific to vehicle sensor configuration, however data labeling is mostly manual process and time consuming. Simulators could be used to produce synthetic labeled data at large scale in the cloud.","LGSVL Simulator also accelerates and facilitates reinforcement learning for Planning module development which requires millions of runs in order to find optimal behavior. LGSVL Simulator features out of box integration with OpenAI Gym environment that allows for running faster than real time locally and in the cloud either as an on-premise or private cloud configuration."]},"section4_old":{"title":"Academia","body":"Automated vehicles (AVs) already navigate highways and local streets of many nations around the world. The societal and transportation infrastructure impacts of these mobile robots will certainly be more extensive than a simple change in the journey between the immediate origin and the destination. Academia has begun to analyze, model and explore the future of smart mobility. LGSVL Simulator enables researchers to explore end-to-end learning approaches that make use of collected sensor data, photo-realistic 3D environments, to re-simulate scenarios for optimizing a model performance in the lab."},"section5_old":{"title":"Robotics","body":"LGSVL Simulator is a tool necessary for the design and validation of development processes in a dynamic and highly visual environment. This tool supports a variety of robotic and automation test scenarios allowing for early validation of automation concepts on local machines or in the cloud.
