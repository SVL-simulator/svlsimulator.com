The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to collect sensor data using SVL Simulator and train an end-to-end deep learning model that would let a car drive autonomously, following lanes. The network is trained to replicate the human steering behavior while driving and collecting data. During the inference phase, it takes camera images from a frontal camera as input and predicts steering angle commands. This project was inspired by NVIDIA's End-to-End Deep Learning Model for Self-Driving Cars.
